# investigraph-api

API playground with example ftm datasets for [investigraph](https://github.com/investigativedata/investigraph)

This repo builds a [ftmstore-fastapi](https://github.com/simonwoerpel/ftmstore-fastapi/) instance with two example datasets built in:
- [European Commission - Meetings with interest representatives](https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/european-commission-meetings-with-interest-representatives?locale=en)
- [EU authorities as collected by AsktheEU.org](https://www.asktheeu.org/en/help/api)

The api runs at https://api.investigraph.ftm.store, where you can find a documentation on how to query the data.
